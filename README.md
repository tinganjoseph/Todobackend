## Introduction

The TODO backend provides a RESTful API that allows you to create, read, update, and delete TODO items. It serves as a backend service for a TODO application, which can be connected to a frontend to create a complete TODO management system.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js: A runtime environment for executing JavaScript code on the server-side.
- Express.js: A minimal and flexible web application framework for Node.js.
- MongoDB: A NoSQL database used to store and manage the TODO items.

## Getting Started

To set up the TODO backend on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tinganjoseph/Todobackend
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd todo-backend
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Set up MongoDB:
   - Ensure you have MongoDB installed and running on your local machine or specify the connection string to a remote MongoDB server in `index.js` (replace `<your-mongodb-connection-string>`).
   - Create a database for the TODO application and set its name in `index.js` (replace `<your-database-name>`).

5. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The server will be running on `http://localhost:3000` by default (you can change the port in `index.js`).

## API Endpoints

The following API endpoints are available for managing TODO items:

- `POST /api/todos`: Create a new TODO item.
- `GET /api/todos`: Get all TODO items.
- `PUT /api/todos/:id`: Update a TODO item by ID.
- `DELETE /api/todos/:id`: Delete a TODO item by ID.

All endpoints expect and return JSON data.
